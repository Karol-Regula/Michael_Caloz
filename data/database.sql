Advantages of using alcohol in  a thermometer are: 1) it freezes at -112 degrees Celsius so it can measure very cold temperatures, 2) alcohol is cheap, 3) alcohol expands rapidly with temperature changes.  Disadvantages of using alcohol in thermometers are 1) alcohol is colourless and needs an additive to be seen, 2) alcohol wets glass which can make it difficult to make readings, 3) alcohol boils at 78 degrees Celsius so it can''t measure hot temperatures, 4) alcohol is a poor conductor of heat.'),

The period represents how many shells the atom has.. Since T has 16 electrons, we start by filling the first two valency shells with the remainder going into the third shell = 2:8:6.

If it is +1 in group I, then you have to add 2 more to get to group III, making element M +3. Since element X is in group VI which is one less than group VII, we subtract 1 to get a -2 valency. Answer: Step 1: Find valencies: Element M (Group III) = +3. Element X (Group VI) = -2. Step 2: Find number of atoms in the compound. We need the valencies to add to zero, so we multiply valencies of the individual elements by a positive whole number to get +6 and -6. Element M: +3 * 2 = +6. Element X: -2 * 3 = -6.

Right side Zn = 1, N = 1, O = 5. They are not balanced. Step 2: Choose a number to multiply the left side by to begin trying to balance the equation. Two is a good number to begin with.

Step 1: Calculate time in seconds. 3.5 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds = 12600 secs. Step 2: Calculate coulombs, C = IT, C = 5 * 12600, C = 63000 Coulombs (C)'),

The cathode was made up of pure gold with a mass of 6.45g. After the electrolysis the cathode was found to weight 9.66g\nQuestion 1: Calculate the number of coulombs of electricity passed. First we need to think about what is given in the problem and what information will be useful to us. We first write out the masses given in the problem. Since it is a problem calculating coulombs in an electrolysis process we will have to know the amount of Ag required for 1F and the conversion of F to C Mass at anode (impure Ag) Ma = 3.45g, Mass at cathode (gold) Mc = 6.45g, After electrolysis, mass of cathode = 9.66g, 108g of Ag = 1F, 1F = 96500C, Now we can begin to solve the problem. Step 1: Calculate the amount of Ag deposited at the cathode. Subtract the original mass from the new mass of the cathode 9.66 - 6.45 = 3.21g. Step 2: Calculate the amount of F required. Divide the grams of Ag deposited at the cathode by the number of grams of Ag required for 1F. 3.21/108= 0.0297F. Step 3: To calculate the required number of coulombs. Multiply the result of step 2 by 96500. C = 0.0297F x 96500 F/C. C = 2868.19 Coulombs. Question 2: What is the percentage purity of the impure silver? To solve this problem we need to find the amount of Ag transferred which represents pure Ag. This was done in Step 1 above by subtracting the original mass from the new mass at the cathode. Mass of pure Ag = 3.21, Mass of impure Ag = 3.45. Now you can divide them, the numerator is the pure Ag and the denominator is the impure Ag. (3.21/3.45) x 100 = 93.04%'),

Question 9: If 80kg of iron ore (Fe2O3) were allowed to react with carbon monoxide (CO) during the extraction process, how many kilograms of iron (Fe), would be obtained? Given: 80kg if iron ore (Fe2O3). Step 1: Find the equation representing the reaction. The left side is just the iron ore + carbon monoxide. The right side will be the products which are iron and the remaining CO. Then balance the equation: Fe2O3 + 3CO = 2Fe + 3CO. Step 2: Step 2: Calculate the number of moles of Fe2O3. Since the mass was given in kg, we need to multiply it by 1000 to get it in grams. Moles of Fe2O3 = (mass of Fe2O3)/(molar mass of Fe2O3). so moles of Fe2O3 = (80x1000)/((56x2)+(16x3)) = 500 moles. Step 3: Calculate the number of moles of Fe. Since there are two atoms of Fe in every molecule of Fe2O3, you will multiply the moles of Fe2O3 by two get the number of moles of Fe produced by one mole of Fe2O3. 500 x 2 = 1000 moles of Fe produced.

To find the percentage composition of an element in a given compound, you need to first find the masses of each element, and then you find the total mass of the compound and divide that total mass by the mass of the element in the question. This will give you the percent composition. Step 1: Find masses of each element in the compound. N = 14, H = 1, S = 32, O = 16. Step 2: Multiply their masses by the number of atoms present in the compound. N = 14 x 2 = 28. H = 4 x 1 x 2 = 8. S = 32. O = 16 x 4 = 64. Step 3: Sum these to get the total mass of the compound. 28 + 8 + 32 + 64 = 132 g/mol. Step 4: Take the mass from step 2 of the element in the question and divide it by the total mass of the compound and multiply by 100 to get a percentage. (28/132)x100 = 21.21%. The percentage composition of N is 21.21%'),
