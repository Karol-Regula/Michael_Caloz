Our project is a Tetea Online access interface to an SQL database that serves over 40,000 children in Tanzania. This information is currently accessible through text messages, but the process to receive information through text is tedious. Over 3/4ths of the users use mobile devices to access the database so mobile usability and low data usage are primary design concerns. The new site also allows administrative accounts to access and edit the information being displayed.
